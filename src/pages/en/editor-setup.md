Customize your code editor to improve the Wromo developer experience and unlock new features.

## VS Code

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a popular code editor for web developers, built by Microsoft. The VS Code engine also powers popular in-browser code editors like [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) and [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/).

Wromo works with any code editor. However, VS Code is our recommended editor for Wromo projects. We maintain an official [Wromo VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wromo-build.wromo-vscode) that unlocks several key features and developer experience improvements for Wromo projects.

- Syntax highlighting for `.wromo` files.
- TypeScript type information for `.wromo` files.
- [VS Code Intellisense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense) for code completion, hints and more.

To get started, install the [Wromo VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wromo-build.wromo-vscode) today.

ðŸ“š See how to [set up TypeScript](/en/guides/typescript/) in your Wromo project.

## In-Browser Editors

In addition to local editors, Wromo also runs well on in-browser hosted editors, including:

- [GitHub.dev](https://github.dev/) - allows you to install the Wromo VS Code extension as a [web extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/web-extensions), which gives you access to only some of the full extension features. Currently, only syntax highlighting is supported.
- [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) - a full dev environment in the cloud that can install the official Wromo VS Code Extension from Open VSX.
