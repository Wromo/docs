You can use [Vercel](http://vercel.com/) to deploy an Wromo site to their global edge network with zero configuration.

This guide includes instructions for deploying to Vercel through the website UI or Vercel's CLI.

## Project Configuration

Your Wromo project can be deployed to Vercel as a static site, or as a server-side rendered site (SSR).

### Static Site

Your Wromo project is a static site by default. You don‚Äôt need any extra configuration to deploy a static Wromo site to Vercel. 

### Adapter for SSR

To enable SSR in your Wromo project and deploy on Vercel:

1. Install [the Vercel adapter](https://github.com/Wromo/wromo/tree/main/packages/integrations/vercel) to your project‚Äôs dependencies.

    ```bash
      npm install --save-dev @wromojs/vercel
    ```

1. Add two new lines to your `wromo.config.mjs` project configuration file.

    ```diff
    // wromo.config.mjs
    import { defineConfig } from 'wromo/config';
    + import vercel from '@wromojs/vercel/serverless';

    export default defineConfig({
    +   adapter: vercel(),
    });
    ```

1. Enable Vercel‚Äôs [Build Output API](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3) by setting the `ENABLE_VC_BUILD` environment variable in `vercel.json`.

    ```js
    {
      "build": {
        "env": {
          "ENABLE_VC_BUILD": "1"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

## How to deploy

You can deploy to Vercel through the website UI or using Vercel‚Äôs CLI (command line interface). The process is the same for both static and SSR Wromo sites.

### Website UI Deployment

1. Push your code to your online Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket).
2. [Import your project](https://vercel.com/new) into Vercel.
3. Vercel will automatically detect Wromo and configure the right settings.
4. Your application is deployed! (e.g. [wromo.vercel.app](https://wromo.vercel.app/))

After your project has been imported and deployed, all subsequent pushes to branches will generate [Preview Deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/environments#preview), and all changes made to the Production Branch (commonly ‚Äúmain‚Äù) will result in a [Production Deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/environments#production).

### CLI Deployment

1. Install the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) and run `vercel` to deploy.

    ```bash
    npm i -g vercel
    vercel
    ```

2. Vercel will automatically detect Wromo and configure the right settings.
3. When asked `Want to override the settings? [y/N]`, choose `N`.
4. Your application is deployed! (e.g. [wromo.vercel.app](https://wromo.vercel.app/))
